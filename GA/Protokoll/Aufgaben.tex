\section{Tasks}

In this lab course we worked with gamma radiation detectors.
The following tasks were to be executed:
\begin{itemize}
\item Calibration of one HPGe and one NaI spectrometer had to be done.
\item Using the HPGe detector, we were tasked with analysing radioactive samples from the region of Fukushima to calculate the date of the Fukushima nuclear accident, by using the activity ratio of $\frac{^{134}\text{Cs}}{^{137}\text{Cs}}$.
\item Using again the HPGe detector, we were given 5 samples of ashe from eastern europe and had to compare the activity of $^{137}$Cs within these samples with a refference source.
\item Last part of this course, was to analyze the attenuation of gamma rays traveling through copper, by using the NaI detector.
end{itemize}
